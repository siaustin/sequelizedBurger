# How to use app: 

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

User also can input the name of which Customer would eat which Burger

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page with the customer name assigned to.

-The input fields have validation functions that do not allow to input empty string.

This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
